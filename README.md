## Pull Request Template

This repo contains a pull request template that can be used to standardize pull requests.

PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md is the default template across all repos.

If you want to add a new template, create a new file in the `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE` directory with the name of the template you want to use.

For example, `bug_fix_template.md`, and configure your repor to use it.
